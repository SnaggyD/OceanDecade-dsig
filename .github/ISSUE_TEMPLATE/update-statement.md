## Procedure

[This section can be deleted before the issue is posted]

DSIG members are encouraged to create short statements to capture ideas on how we can implement the UN Ocean Decade Data and Information Strategy. 

These statements are stored in: https://github.com/iodepo/OceanDecade-dsig/tree/main/statements

If a DSIG member or their delegate wishes to add or update a statement, they will open and issue and use this template to propose changes and initiate a discussion. Once a resolution is reached, the statement may be modified and the issue closed.

Be sure to add the number of the issue in any commit messages used to update the relevant statement(s). For example, Issue number 8 was tagged in this commit message: https://github.com/iodepo/OceanDecade-dsig/commit/293f3dfa4e540297622bab97b7770cbe8d8dad21
