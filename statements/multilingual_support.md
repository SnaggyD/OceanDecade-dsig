# Multilingual support

## Relevant Objectives

Objective 1

## Region(s) of relevance

Global

## Recommendation(s)

In order to promote equitable access we should recommend that participating systems offer multilingual support.
 - Where possible, translations should be done by a human interpreter with both linguistic and domain-level expertise.
 - Where automatic translation is necessary, UI/UXs should provide very visible disclaimers and offer access to the records in their original languages.
 - UN Languages are of high value, however, the languages chosen for translations should be appropriate to the communities that are most impacted by the (meta)data served, which may not always overlap with those that commission or consume the data.
 - Increase support for First Nations languages in automatic / web-based translators and/or character sets.

## Relation to existing capacities / initiatives

- Support to communities is done by training and workhops. Human input necessary.
- FAO's [AGROVOC](https://agrovoc.fao.org/browse/agrovoc/en/) has a well-developed approach to multi-lingual interpretations, worth delving deeper

## Resourcing required

resources for training, recurrent funding for interpreters, automatic translation tools

## Caveats, concerns, and limitations 

 - Professsional interpreters can be expensive
 - Volunteer translations will require quality assurance
