# Ensure (meta)data discovery at all levels of processing

## Relevant Objectives

Objective 1, 2, 5

## Region(s) of relevance

Global

## Recommendation(s)

Discovery of (meta)data at all levels of processing (from raw data, to data products) should be as "web-friendly" as possible, using standard web architectural approaches (e.g. as recommended by the W3C) so that many stakeholders across very different digital cultures can easily implement them. 

## Relation to existing capacities / initiatives

- Leveraging JSON-LD and schema.org (as used by the world's major search providers), stakeholders can express metadata about their digital holdings in a way that many can detect, discover, and understand (in in the ocean community and beyond)
- Leverage and co-develop the conventions being built by the IODE's Ocean Data and Information System (ODIS) and Ocean InfoHub to stabilise exchange among ocean stakeholders.

## Resourcing required

Provide rough indications of what kind of resources are required to implement the recommendation. 
These should include estimates of training costs, personnel and their qualifications, monetary estimates for personnel, equipment, etc, and administrative support. 

## Caveats, concerns, and limitations
