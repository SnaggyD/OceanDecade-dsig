# Managing data confidentiality issues

## Strategic relevance

Policy & Regulatory Frameworks Enabler

## Region(s) and/or Communities of relevance

**Regions:** Global

## Importance and Urgency

**Importance:** high

**Urgency:** [critical, very high, high, neither high nor low, low, very low]

**Timeframe for implementation:** Where relevant, comment on what timeframe this recommendation should be acted upon, with a brief explanation on your rationale.

## Recommendation(s)

Where data is confidential and cannot be publically released in a detailed state then the "Managing Confidential Data" guidance should be followed

This doesn't exist yet but coudl include the following:
1. Metadata should still be published
2. If the confidentiality is time-sensitive then the use of embargo periods should be investigated i.e. it may be possible to release the data at a future date.
3. Statistical practices such as aggregation or suppression should be investigated to see whether a form of the data that does not violate the relevant confidentiality rules can be released.  Guidance for these techniques is available at XXX


## Relation to existing capacities / initiatives

What existing activities in the regions noted above can be engaged to implement the recommendation?

## Resourcing required

Provide rough indications of what kind of resources are required to implement the recommendation. 
These should include estimates of training costs, personnel and their qualifications, monetary estimates for personnel, equipment, etc, and administrative support. 

## Caveats, concerns, and limitations 

- There can be many reasons for data to be confidential (e.g. commercial sensitivity, legal requirements) so it will not be possible to comment on individual cases just the general approaches.
- It might not be possible to create a useful non-confidential version of a particualr data e.g. the process of sufficiently aggregating or supressing the data removes its utility.
