## Recommendation(s)

Where data is confidential and cannot be publically released in a detailed state:
1. Metadata should still be published
2. If the confidentiality is time-sensitive then the use of embargo periods should be investigated i.e. it may be possible to release the data at a future date.
3. Statistical practices such as aggregation or suppression should be investigated to see whether a form of the data that does not violate the relevant confidentiality rules can be released.  Guidance for these techniques is available at XXX
