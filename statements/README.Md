## About 

A directory to collect stand-alone statements to be integrated into the main document.


## What is a 'statement'?

As a globally distributed team of extraordinarily busy people, the DSIG needed a transparent and asynchronous way to articulate their thoughts, concerns, and initial recommendations. 

We chose to capture our team's initial statements as Markdown files in this directory, following a basic template.

These statements will provide the raw material with which we will build the Implementation guidance, and also allow anyone to post issues on our issue tracker to deliberate around each statement.


## Making a statement 

To create a new statement, a DSIG member whose GitHub account has been granted write privileges in this repo will: 

1. Copy the Markdown code from the template in this directory.

1. Create a new file in this directory, naming it according to its subject **and ensuring to give it an .md extension**. For example - "open-vs-free.md" 

1. Paste the template's Markdown into the new file, and modify it to capture their thoughts.

1. When done, commit the changes made, adding a message if needed. 

Note that one can always start a rough draft and add / revise it later.
