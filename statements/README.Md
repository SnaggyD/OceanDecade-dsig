## About 

A directory to collect stand-alone statements to be integrated into the main document.


## What is a 'statement'?

As a globally distributed team of extraordinarily busy people, the DSIG needed a transparent and asynchronous way to articulate their thoughts, concerns, and initial recommendations. 

We chose to capture our team's initial statements as Markdown files in this directory, following a basic template.

These statements will provide the raw material with which we will build the Implementation guidance, and also allow anyone to post issues on our issue tracker to deliberate around each statement.


## Making a statement 

The following assumes you're using the GitHub web interface. If you're working in a local directory with the git command-line interface or the GitHub Client, it's likely you don't need futher guidance. 

To create a new statement, a DSIG member whose GitHub account has been granted write privileges in this repo will: 

1. Navigate to the statements directory: `OceanDecade-dsig/statements`
1. Copy the Markdown code from the template in this directory (entitled `template.Md`). To do this, click on the `template.Md` file, and then on the "Code" button between the "Preview" and "Blame" buttons on the web interface. Select all the code and copy it to your clipboard. 
1. Create a new file in this directory, using the "Add file" button. 
1. Name the file according to its subject **and ensure that you give it an .md or .Md extension**. For example - `open-vs-free.md` 
1. Paste the template's Markdown that you copied a couple of steps ago into the new file, and modify it to capture their thoughts.
1. When done, save the changes made using the "Commit changes..." button (usually in green), adding a commit message if needed. 

Note that one can always start a rough draft and add / revise it later using the edit function (an icon that looks like a pencil) when viewing the file preview.

# Commenting on the statements of others

If you'd like to add to an existing statement, please create an issue and tag the author of the statement to inform them of the changes you intend to make. With their go ahead, modify the statement using the edit function and add the number of the issue you opened to the commit message, prefixed by a # sign. For example, "Adding content as discussed in #5". This will crosslink the issue and your commit message for better contextualisation.
